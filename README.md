# Pokemon Memory Card

There are twelve pokemon cards on the gameboard. The player selects a card by clicking it. The player should also remember which card he/she have selected. 
The is then reshuffled. This goes on, until:

- The player selects a card that has already been chosen, the game resets, and all cards must be selected again from the beginning. Or,
- The player has selected twelve cards.
